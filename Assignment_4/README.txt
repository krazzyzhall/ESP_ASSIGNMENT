on x-axis plane is capable of rotating between -180 to 180 with very less  less error.
on y-axis plane is capable of rotating between -90 to 90 from earth reference with very less error. it introduces error to x-axis if goes beyong -90 or 90.
on z-axis it varies between -180 to 180 very erronous and might change its pivot. 

X-axis - coming out of the screen.
