Main component of a message bus is its Daemon bus component which manages its connections and forwards messgaes through message queues.

D bus reference:- http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings/

needed to develop:

1)  a device driver for shared queues which performs the basic enqueue and dequeue operations and records the accumulated queuing time (a      _   queueing time is the elapse time between enqueue and dequeue operations) 

2)  A test program that initiates multiple thread to accessthe shared queues.


name of device driver squeue.


bus_out_q1
bus_in_q
bus_out_q2
bus_out_q3
 are device files created 


Each message is represented by a message id, source and destination ids , an accumulated queueing time , and a variable -length character string of maximal length 80.


queuing time is computed by :
When a message is dequeued, its queueing time is computed by the driver based on the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) values of the enqueue and dequeue instants. 

The accumulated queueing time of a message is the total queueing time since its first enqueue operation. 

operations to be implemented in Device Driver:
open( queue) --for opening the device  
write --to enqueue a message to the device returns -1 or EINVAL
read to dequeue the message.
release  -- release the file structure
